    "# Patient Readmission Exploration\n",

    "### Project Background: \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patient readmission is a powerful indicator of quality of care across the healthcare industry. Readmission is when a person is admitted to the hospital within 30 days of a previous discharge because there was some aspect of their care that was not handled or their condition is worsening. Health care providers and insurers frequently track patient readmission rates from hospital systems to better understand the quality of care provided at those facilities and how that affects patient outcomes. Understanding which hospitals have high readmission rates can help policymakers and insurers launch targeted improvement programs or understand what areas may need more resources.  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this context in mind, I am interested in creating a model to predict hospital readmission rates based on quality of care metrics for the Medicare population. I hope to understand what facets of quality of care most impact patient readmission rate for medicare patients. To do this I would most likely perform a regression analysis of readmission rate for each hospital/care system and their corresponding care metrics. Understanding the relationships between patient readmission and quality of care could also help policymakers adjust provider and insurer incentive structures to prioritize the health of individuals.\n",

    "### Data Sources:  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All data collected for this project came [data.cms.gov](data.cms.gov). First of which is the[Hospital General Information dataset](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/xubh-q36u#overview) which contains information on all hospitals that have registered with Medicare. Some of the information in this dataset includes address, type of hospital, ownership type (i.e. non-profit, government) and overall rating. Next I will be using the [Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP)](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/9n3s-kdb3) dataset, which includes information about the number of discharges, number of readmissions, and ratio of readmissions for each facility that is registered with Medicare. The readmission rate would be the outcome variable for the predictive model. Next, I will be using the [Timely and Effective Care](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/yv7e-xc69) table that contains information on how hospitals perform on a variety of clinical measures like average time patients wait to be seen in the emergency department and appropriate care rating given to patients with sepsis. These measures are available for each of the hospitals that are registered with Medicare, so the measure ratings could be used as predictors for readmission rate. The license for all of these data sets is not explicitly stated, but according to an FAQ guide for using data from data.cms.gov, “Works of the U.S. Government are in the public domain and you don’t need permission to reuse them, but an attribution to the agency as the source is appreciated.” \n",
